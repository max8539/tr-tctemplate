# tr-tctemplate
A repository of template `testconfig.json` files for use with [test-runner.js](https://github.com/max8539/test-runner).

Replace the `testconfig.json` file in the `tests` directory with one of these template files, then fill in information specific to your project, such as filenames and additional commands that should be run, and tweak the other settings to your needs.

Ensure that your modified file is still called `testconfig.json`, and it is saved in the `tests` directory of your project.

## Contributing
Please do not change or remove any existing templates unless they have serious errors.  
You are welcome to add your own templates here. Create a directory with a suitable name for your template, and save your template inside that folder as `testconfig.json`.
